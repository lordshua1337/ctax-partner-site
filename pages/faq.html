        <h2 class="sh mb32">The Basics</h2>
        <div class="faq-item open"><div class="faq-q" onclick="toggleFaq(this)"><h4>What is the minimum tax balance you work with?</h4><span class="faq-tog">+</span></div><div class="faq-a"><p>The general rule is that the most value is delivered with clients who owe at least <strong>$7,000 or more</strong> in total tax debt. This can be a combination of multiple tax years or a single year — the threshold applies to the total outstanding balance.</p></div></div>
        <div class="faq-item reveal"><div class="faq-q" onclick="toggleFaq(this)"><h4>Does everyone qualify for a balance reduction (Offer in Compromise)?</h4><span class="faq-tog">+</span></div><div class="faq-a"><p>No. Part of our two-phase approach is providing a transparent, expectation-setting experience. While we always look for debt reductions, not all clients will qualify. We explain this clearly on our initial call — we never make promises we can't keep.</p></div></div>
        <div class="faq-item reveal"><div class="faq-q" onclick="toggleFaq(this)"><h4>What does this cost the client?</h4><span class="faq-tog">+</span></div><div class="faq-a"><p>Each client is contracted for a <strong>Tax Investigation fee of $295</strong> (businesses add $500). After the investigation, we present a flat cost to resolve their liability. Approximately <strong>80% of investigated clients</strong> elect to proceed. We offer discounts and payment plans so we don't turn away clients due to inability to pay.</p></div></div>
        <div class="faq-item reveal"><div class="faq-q" onclick="toggleFaq(this)"><h4>Do you offer any guarantee?</h4><span class="faq-tog">+</span></div><div class="faq-a"><p>Yes — a <strong>money-back Service Guarantee</strong>. If the Investigation is complete and we cannot offer any qualifying services, we refund the Investigation fee in full. Note: this is a service guarantee, not a satisfaction guarantee.</p></div></div>
        <div class="faq-item reveal"><div class="faq-q" onclick="toggleFaq(this)"><h4>Will my clients keep their tax preparation with me?</h4><span class="faq-tog">+</span></div><div class="faq-a"><p>Yes — always. We provide resolution services only. Partners who don't refer often lose that prep work anyway when clients find resolution help elsewhere — and those firms then solicit the future preparation. Referring us protects your prep revenue.</p></div></div>
        <div class="faq-item reveal"><div class="faq-q" onclick="toggleFaq(this)"><h4>What states does the program cover?</h4><span class="faq-tog">+</span></div><div class="faq-a"><p>We operate in <strong>48 states</strong> — nationwide with the exception of Minnesota and North Dakota. For state tax balances, we currently work with California and New York exclusively.</p></div></div>
      </div>
      <div id="faq-revenue" class="faq-sec">
        <h2 class="sh mb32">Revenue &amp; Compensation</h2>
        <div class="faq-item open"><div class="faq-q" onclick="toggleFaq(this)"><h4>How does partner revenue share work?</h4><span class="faq-tog">+</span></div><div class="faq-a"><p>Partners earn a percentage of the fees Community Tax collects on referred cases. The exact revenue share percentage is established in your partner agreement and scales with your tier — Direct, Enterprise, or Strategic. All terms are disclosed before you sign anything.</p></div></div>
        <div class="faq-item reveal"><div class="faq-q" onclick="toggleFaq(this)"><h4>What does the average case pay a partner?</h4><span class="faq-tog">+</span></div><div class="faq-a"><p>Resolution cases vary significantly in complexity and total fees — simpler installment agreement cases tend to be on the lower end, while Offer in Compromise cases can command substantially higher fees. Revenue share on a single closed case can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars. Your partner manager will walk through realistic expectations based on your client profile.</p></div></div>
        <div class="faq-item reveal"><div class="faq-q" onclick="toggleFaq(this)"><h4>When do I get paid?</h4><span class="faq-tog">+</span></div><div class="faq-a"><p>Revenue share is paid after the referred client's case is contracted and initial fees are collected — not after full resolution. You do not have to wait 12–18 months for an OIC to close before you receive compensation. Payout schedules are confirmed during onboarding.</p></div></div>
        <div class="faq-item reveal"><div class="faq-q" onclick="toggleFaq(this)"><h4>Is there a minimum referral volume to stay active as a partner?</h4><span class="faq-tog">+</span></div><div class="faq-a"><p>Direct partners have no minimum volume requirements. Enterprise and Strategic partners agree to volume commitments as part of their tier structure — these are established collaboratively based on your client base and are designed to be achievable, not punitive.</p></div></div>
        <div class="faq-item reveal"><div class="faq-q" onclick="toggleFaq(this)"><h4>Are there any fees to join the partner program?</h4><span class="faq-tog">+</span></div><div class="faq-a"><p>No. There is no cost to become a Community Tax partner at any tier. We earn when you earn — our incentive is to make your referral program as productive as possible.</p></div></div>
        <div class="faq-item reveal"><div class="faq-q" onclick="toggleFaq(this)"><h4>How do I track what I've earned?</h4><span class="faq-tog">+</span></div><div class="faq-a"><p>A partner portal with real-time referral tracking and revenue reporting is in active development. Until launch, your dedicated partner manager provides regular pipeline updates and revenue statements. Enterprise and Strategic partners receive monthly reporting as part of their tier.</p></div></div>
      </div>
      <div id="faq-clients" class="faq-sec">
        <h2 class="sh mb32">Identifying Clients</h2>
        <div class="faq-item open"><div class="faq-q" onclick="toggleFaq(this)"><h4>Who is a target client?</h4><span class="faq-tog">+</span></div><div class="faq-a"><p>Start with tax returns you've prepared that have outstanding balances — and ask: <em>"Do you have any additional balances from prior years?"</em> The ideal client owes $7,000+ and cannot or does not want to pay it back in full or within 4 months.</p></div></div>
        <div class="faq-item reveal"><div class="faq-q" onclick="toggleFaq(this)"><h4>What about clients who've tried to fix this on their own?</h4><span class="faq-tog">+</span></div><div class="faq-a"><p>This is an ideal referral. Resolving IRS problems independently is tedious and complex. Clients who have tried and failed are often the most motivated to accept professional help.</p></div></div>
        <div class="faq-item reveal"><div class="faq-q" onclick="toggleFaq(this)"><h4>What about clients facing active enforcement — notices, garnishments, levies?</h4><span class="faq-tog">+</span></div><div class="faq-a"><p>Excellent referrals. We can explain threatening notices, work with local IRS agents, and obtain garnishment and wage levy releases. Active enforcement creates urgency — these clients are highly motivated to engage immediately.</p></div></div>
        <div class="faq-item reveal"><div class="faq-q" onclick="toggleFaq(this)"><h4>Can we help undocumented clients with tax problems?</h4><span class="faq-tog">+</span></div><div class="faq-a"><p>Yes. The IRS and ICE are completely separate agencies. Fixing tax problems is essential on the path to documentation and citizenship — and our bilingual team serves Spanish-speaking clients with the same expertise.</p></div></div>
        <div class="faq-item reveal"><div class="faq-q" onclick="toggleFaq(this)"><h4>What if the IRS keeps my client's refund every year?</h4><span class="faq-tog">+</span></div><div class="faq-a"><p>If the IRS is intercepting annual refunds or a client has been denied an Easy Advance, there is almost certainly a back tax liability. These are strong indicators to initiate a referral. Note: Community Tax does not handle stimulus payments or refund status inquiries.</p></div></div>
      </div>
      <div id="faq-process" class="faq-sec">
        <h2 class="sh mb32">The Process</h2>
        <div class="faq-item open"><div class="faq-q" onclick="toggleFaq(this)"><h4>When does Community Tax reach out after a referral?</h4><span class="faq-tog">+</span></div><div class="faq-a"><p>As soon as you submit the client's information through the referral portal. During business hours, we aim to make contact <strong>within minutes</strong>. Speed drives conversion, and we move fast on every referral.</p></div></div>
        <div class="faq-item reveal"><div class="faq-q" onclick="toggleFaq(this)"><h4>How long does the tax resolution process take?</h4><span class="faq-tog">+</span></div><div class="faq-a"><p>Phase 1 (Tax Investigation) averages <strong>1–7 business days</strong>. Phase 2 (Resolution) varies — some agreements can be in place in 7–10 days; an Offer in Compromise can take up to 18 months. We set proper expectations after the Investigation is complete.</p></div></div>
        <div class="faq-item reveal"><div class="faq-q" onclick="toggleFaq(this)"><h4>My clients trust me — how will I stay involved?</h4><span class="faq-tog">+</span></div><div class="faq-a"><p>We prefer to work directly with clients to take the load off you, but you own the relationship. As the referring partner, you have dedicated support channels at your discretion. A client portal is in development for real-time referral tracking.</p></div></div>
        <div class="faq-item reveal"><div class="faq-q" onclick="toggleFaq(this)"><h4>Why shouldn't I just handle this myself?</h4><span class="faq-tog">+</span></div><div class="faq-a"><p>Non-credentialed tax professionals have limited representation rights — they cannot handle appeals or collection matters. EAs, Tax Attorneys, and CPAs have unlimited representation rights. This is what we do for thousands of clients every month. Your time is more valuable spent on returns and growing your client base.</p></div></div>
      </div>
      <div id="faq-programs" class="faq-sec">
        <h2 class="sh mb32">IRS Programs</h2>
        <div class="faq-item open"><div class="faq-q" onclick="toggleFaq(this)"><h4>What IRS programs do clients qualify for?</h4><span class="faq-tog">+</span></div><div class="faq-a"><p>Programs are determined by the client's income, assets, and expenses. Options include Installment Agreements, Currently Not Collectible status, Offer in Compromise (settlement), Penalty Abatement, and more. The Tax Investigation phase pre-qualifies the client for the best possible outcome.</p></div></div>
        <div class="faq-item reveal"><div class="faq-q" onclick="toggleFaq(this)"><h4>What is the "Fresh Start Program" and "People's First Initiative"?</h4><span class="faq-tog">+</span></div><div class="faq-a"><p>These were IRS internal guideline adjustments designed to add flexibility to program qualification criteria, speed up approval times, and encourage taxpayers to resolve their tax matters.</p></div></div>
        <div class="faq-item reveal"><div class="faq-q" onclick="toggleFaq(this)"><h4>Does Community Tax handle back state taxes?</h4><span class="faq-tog">+</span></div><div class="faq-a"><p>We currently work with state balances from <strong>California and New York exclusively</strong>. State authorities are often harder to reach and less cooperative than the IRS — we only offer services we can reliably deliver.</p></div></div>
      </div>
      <div id="faq-referrals" class="faq-sec">
        <h2 class="sh mb32">Referrals &amp; Tracking</h2>
        <div class="faq-item open"><div class="faq-q" onclick="toggleFaq(this)"><h4>I already referred a client — how do I check status?</h4><span class="faq-tog">+</span></div><div class="faq-a"><p>A client portal is in active development for real-time referral tracking. Until launch, email <strong><a href="mailto:partners@communitytax.com">partners@communitytax.com</a></strong>. You can also facilitate a direct introduction between your client and our enrollment team.</p></div></div>
        <div class="faq-item reveal"><div class="faq-q" onclick="toggleFaq(this)"><h4>Who do I call with questions about an active referral?</h4><span class="faq-tog">+</span></div><div class="faq-a"><p>Contact our dedicated Partner Products Manager, <strong>Norm Brumfield at 773-796-2289</strong>. Norm is your resource for questions about timing, costs, process, and anything related to an active or pending referral.</p></div></div>
      </div>
      <div id="faq-presenting" class="faq-sec">
        <h2 class="sh mb32">Presenting to Clients</h2>
        <div class="faq-item open"><div class="faq-q" onclick="toggleFaq(this)"><h4>How should I introduce Community Tax to a client?</h4><span class="faq-tog">+</span></div><div class="faq-a"><p>Keep it simple: <em>"We've partnered with one of the nation's largest and most established tax resolution companies. They offer a no-cost, no-obligation consultation — just talk to them and they'll explain your options."</em> Our enrollment team handles the rest.</p></div></div>
        <div class="faq-item reveal"><div class="faq-q" onclick="toggleFaq(this)"><h4>What if a client is embarrassed about their tax situation?</h4><span class="faq-tog">+</span></div><div class="faq-a"><p>Normalize it. Millions of Americans owe back taxes. The initial consultation is free, confidential, and obligation-free. We are bilingual and skilled at creating a judgment-free experience for clients who feel intimidated by the IRS.</p></div></div>
