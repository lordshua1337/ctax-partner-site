      "description": "An IRS program that allows taxpayers to settle their tax debt for less than the full amount owed. The IRS evaluates the taxpayer's income, assets, expenses, and ability to pay to determine an acceptable offer amount. Not all taxpayers qualify — the IRS acceptance rate for OICs is approximately 30-40% of submitted applications. The process typically takes 6-18 months from submission to decision.",

      "description": "A payment plan between a taxpayer and the IRS that allows the taxpayer to pay their tax debt in monthly installments over time, rather than in a single lump sum. Installment agreements can be set up for balances of any size, though terms vary. Short-term agreements (120 days or less) and long-term agreements (up to 72 months) are available depending on the amount owed and the taxpayer's financial situation.",

      "description": "A status the IRS assigns to a taxpayer's account when they demonstrate they cannot afford to pay their tax debt without causing financial hardship. While in CNC status, the IRS temporarily suspends collection activity — no levies, garnishments, or seizures. The debt remains on the books and accrues interest and penalties, but the taxpayer is not required to make payments. The IRS reviews CNC status periodically.",

The IRS may abate penalties for reasonable cause (such as serious illness, natural disaster, or reliance on professional advice), first-time penalty abatement (for taxpayers with a clean compliance history), or statutory exceptions. Penalty abatement does not reduce the underlying tax owed — it only removes the penalty charges, which can amount to 25% or more of the original tax liability.",

To qualify, the requesting spouse must demonstrate they did not know about and had no reason to know about the understatement of tax. Innocent Spouse Relief is filed using IRS Form 8857 and applies only to jointly filed returns.",

      "description": "A legal claim the IRS places against a taxpayer's property — including real estate, personal property, and financial assets — when the taxpayer fails to pay a tax debt after receiving a notice and demand for payment. A federal tax lien affects the taxpayer's credit and attaches to all current and future assets. The lien is released within 30 days of paying the debt in full or when the IRS accepts an Offer in Compromise.",

      "description": "The legal seizure of a taxpayer's property or assets to satisfy an unpaid tax debt. Unlike a lien (which is a claim against property), a levy is the actual taking of property. The IRS can levy bank accounts, wages, Social Security benefits, retirement accounts, and other income or assets. The IRS must provide a Final Notice of Intent to Levy at least 30 days before seizing assets, giving the taxpayer time to respond or arrange payment.",

      "description": "A type of levy in which the IRS directs a taxpayer's employer to withhold a portion of their wages and send it directly to the IRS to pay outstanding tax debt. IRS wage garnishments are more aggressive than most creditor garnishments — the IRS determines the exempt amount (the portion the taxpayer keeps) based on filing status and number of dependents using Publication 1494. The remaining wages are sent to the IRS until the debt is paid or an alternative arrangement is made.",

Form 2848 grants the authorized representative the ability to receive confidential tax information, negotiate on behalf of the taxpayer, sign agreements, and attend IRS meetings.

Revenue Officers are field agents who visit taxpayers in person, unlike IRS phone agents. They have the authority to seize assets, file liens, levy bank accounts, and pursue other collection actions. Cases assigned to Revenue Officers are typically higher-dollar and higher-priority, and having professional representation when dealing with a Revenue Officer is strongly recommended.",
